Currently, I am *Ph.D. Student in Political Science* of the Graduate Research Group [Resilient Institutions](https://resilient.institutions.uni-mainz.de/) at the *University of Mainz*.

I receive a scholarship founded by the *Gutenberg Council for Young Researchers*.

In my dissertation project on *Episodes of democratic erosion -- sequences, opportunity structures, and patterns of autocratization* under the supervision of [Claudia Landwehr](https://theorie.politik.uni-mainz.de/univ-prof-dr-claudia-landwehr/), I am aiming to contribute to the debate on democratic resilience.

I hold a B.A. and an M.A. in *Political and Social Sciences* from the *University of WÃ¼rzburg*.

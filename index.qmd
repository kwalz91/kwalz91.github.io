I am a Ph.D. student of the interdisciplinary Graduate Research Group [Resilient Institutions](https://resilient.institutions.uni-mainz.de/) at the University of Mainz.

My research interests cluster around means of Comparative Politics and especially Democracy Research on the macro-level. In particular, I am interested in *why* and *how* Democracies decline, what makes Democracies more or less resilient in the face of contemporary stressors, and what we can learn from this for sustainable democratic (re-)institutionalization.

You can find my full CV [here](about.qmd).

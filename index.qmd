I am a Ph.D. student of the interdisciplinary Graduate Research Group [Resilient Institutions](https://resilient.institutions.uni-mainz.de/) at the University of Mainz.

My research interests cluster around means of comparative politics and especially democracy research on the macro-level. In particular, I am interested in *why* and *how* democracies decline, what makes democracies more or less resilient in the face of contemporary stressors, and what we can learn from this for sustainable democratic (re-)institutionalization.

I often work theory-led not only in the sense of applying concepts or analytical theories of comparative politics such as historical and actor-centered institutionalism, partisan theory, or power resources approaches. I am also digging deeper into (normative) Political Theory when meaningful. Therefore, I am also interested in and competent in conceptions of democracy (e.g., deliberative democracy), anti-democratic ideologies, nationalism, and political representation.

Methodologically, I am influenced by Arend Lijphart's work on comparative methods. I am proficient in comparative research designs, quantitative data analysis, and process tracing. Therefore, I consider myself a fan of mixed-methods approaches.

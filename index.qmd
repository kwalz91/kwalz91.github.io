I am a Ph.D. student in the interdisciplinary Graduate Research Group [*Resilient Institutions*](https://resilient.institutions.uni-mainz.de/) at the University of Mainz.

My research interests cluster around means of comparative politics and especially democracy research. In particular, I engage in issues of comparative regime research, democratic legitimacy and deficit, the transformation of political systems, and democratic resilience.

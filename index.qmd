I am a Ph.D. student of the interdisciplinary Graduate Research Group [Resilient Institutions](https://resilient.institutions.uni-mainz.de/) at the University of Mainz.

My research interests cluster around means of comparative politics and especially democracy research. In particular, I am engaged in issues of comparative regime research, democratic legitimacy and deficit, the transformation of political systems, and democratic resilience.

You can find my full CV [here](about.qmd).

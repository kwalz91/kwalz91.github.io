    "section": "What is Anti-Pluralism?",
    "text": "What is Anti-Pluralism?\nLinz (1978) already associated the temperaments or ideologies of political candidates and parties with the breakdown of democratic regimes. According to his analysis, specific attitudes of political actors can be considered a predictor of undemocratic intentions and behavior in office – and thereby ultimately also of democratic decline. It is not a coincidence that Linz’s model for measuring those attitudes – the so-called ‘litmus test’ – was adopted only recently by scholars like Levitsky and Ziblatt (2018). Lührmann et al. (2021) explicitly associate the litmus test with the term Anti-Pluralism, which has become some kind of buzzword afterward. However, we can identify at least two quite fundamental shortcomings in the literature focusing on the correlation between Anti-Pluralism and autocratization. First, there is a lack of theoretical discussion on what the concept of Anti-Pluralism includes and what not. Second, there is no comprehensive theoretical reasoning that Anti-Pluralism represents a better analytical concept than other eligible isms. This contribution aims to address these shortcomings systematically."

    "text": "A new game in town: Democratic resilience and the added value of the concept in explaining democratic survival and decline\nwith Johannes Helgest, Lion Merten, Jana Niedringhaus, and Matthias Rosenthal\nResilience has become a hot topic in research due to impactful events and processes such as the global climate crisis or the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, research linking resilience with democratic processes is still spread thin. This paper aims to contribute to this research field by examining the concepts of resilience throughout various disciplines and applying them to the context of democracies, building on recent advances in this field. In our view, democratic resilience is best understood as a democratic system's capacity to process upcoming stressors. This capacity can moderate the extent to which a certain stressor poses a threat to the system. Consequently, this moderation can result in five different outcome scenarios on the regime level – improvement, continuation, bounce back, decline, and breakdown. We argue that in comparison with traditional approaches such as democratic consolidation the concept of democratic resilience holds significant added value. This is mostly due to the concept's dynamic character and its ability to analytically include certain stressors, which enables a more fine-grained understanding of democratic survival and decline."

    "text": "Typologizing processes of autocratization – How to integrate time, outcome, and context?\nThe so-called „third wave of autocratization” is characterized by the slow death of democratic institutions and regimes. Those processes are mostly not contingent but the result of deliberate actions by democratically elected governments. Consequently, the term democratic backsliding became the buzzword in democracy research to catch those processes conceptually and is utilized in numerous empirical studies. Only recently, examinations by Sato et al. (2022) and Wunsch & Blanchard (2022) aimed to identifysequential patterns of autocratization or democratic backsliding respectively.\nNonetheless, at least two crucial questions have not been (sufficiently) addressed so far; First, we lack theoretically as well as empirically sound yardsticks to distinguish between disruptive and gradual processes. Second, established typologies of democratic decline still fall short regarding what Gerschewski (2021) calls the “Missing Diagonal” of institutional change. This contribution addresses both issues aiming to gain new insights into the specifics of slow and fast processes ending up in a precise typologization of processes of democratic decline. I plea for a two-level conceptualization that takes into account time and outcome of autocratization processes. Based on this and, referring to the Episodes of Regime Transformation Dataset (ERT), I will show empirically that the decline of democraticquality per year together with the duration of an autocratization episode relative to the electoral cycle can be considered key to differentiate between rather slow and rather fast processes of autocratization. Going on from this and applying a set-theoretic approach, I will examine whether slow and fast processes depend on distinct configurations of context, and what we can take away from this regarding the “Missing Diagonal” and for further typology building."
